# Website for LA Tech's 2024 Senior Capstone
CHH02's CapstoneWebsite is a github repo to manage the development and history of a website to function with their group senior capstone project. With the goal of a sleek, simple and functional design to better showcase graphically the critical features of their capstone project. Note that the version of the website in this repo is a more bare prototype of what was presented with the capstone project. Due to limited time in development and other projects or life events, the website remains bare and simple with plans in the future for potential further development or to be repurposed to different projects.
### Please Feel Free To View This Version Of The Website [Here](https://chh02.github.io/CapstoneWebsite/) (https://chh02.github.io/CapstoneWebsite/) Being Hosted On Hithub Pages
As said before it is a little bare bones and not fully finished although I feel it does and did an excellent job showcasing some fundamental understanding of CSS and HTML as well as effectively showcasing the senior capstone project's functions more visually during capstone presentations.
